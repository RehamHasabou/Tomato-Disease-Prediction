🍅 Tomato Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict tomato plant diseases based on environmental conditions and leaf characteristics. By analyzing Leaf Spot Size, Leaf Color Index, Temperature, and Humidity, we can classify whether a tomato plant is diseased or healthy.
📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains 500 samples with the following features:

    Leaf_Spot_Size – Measures the severity of leaf spots.
    Leaf_Color_Index – Indicates leaf color changes due to stress or disease.
    Temperature – The surrounding temperature (°C).
    Humidity – The air moisture percentage.
    Disease – The target variable (Healthy/Diseased).

Summary Statistics

    Leaf Spot Size: Ranges from 1.76 to 8.85, with an average of 5.01.
    Leaf Color Index: Values between 36.52 and 63.16.
    Temperature & Humidity: Influence disease spread, ranging from 16.2°C to 27.2°C and 45.3% to 76.0%, respectively.

🚀 Project Goals

    Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key disease indicators.
    Train Machine Learning models to predict plant disease.
    Optimize models using feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
